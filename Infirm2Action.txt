    ❯❱ java.lang.security.audit.tainted-session-from-http-request.tainted-session-from-http-request
          Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a session command, like `setAttribute`. User    
          input into such a command could lead to an attacker inputting malicious code into your session      
          parameters, blurring the line between what's trusted and untrusted, and therefore leading to a trust
          boundary violation. This could lead to programmers trusting unvalidated data. Instead, thoroughly   
          sanitize user input before passing it into such function calls.

    ❯❱ java.lang.security.audit.xss.no-direct-response-writer.no-direct-response-writer
          Detected a request with potential user-input going into a OutputStream or Writer object. This      
          bypasses any view or template environments, including HTML escaping, which may expose this         
          application to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Consider using a view technology such as
          JavaServer Faces (JSFs) which automatically escapes HTML views.
