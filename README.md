## What is Open-O

The code released and maintained in this repo is the same core code that OpenOSP runs and develops as an EMR for use by its clients. This software is licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL) v2**.  OpenOSP and the many others involved with current development of this code believe strongly in the value of open-source software in healthcare.  This license means:

1. **Freedom to Modify and Distribute**: You are free to modify and distribute the software, but any modifications or derived works must also be licensed under GPL v2. This ensures that the software remains open-source, and any improvements are shared back with the community.

2. **Source Code Availability**: If you distribute any modified versions or binaries, you must also provide access to the corresponding source code. This helps maintain transparency and allows other users to build on your changes.

3. **No Warranty or Liability**: As with all GPL-licensed software, Open-O comes with **no warranty**, either express or implied. The software is provided "as is," meaning that OpenOSP, the project contributors, and any others involved are not liable for any issues, damages, or legal claims arising from the use of the software. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations in their jurisdiction when using or distributing the software.

Please review the GPL v2 license for further details.
OpenOSP EMR continues to evolve through community-driven development, providing a robust solution tailored for modern healthcare challenges.

## Who is OpenOSP
OpenOSP is a member-owned cooperative, formed by doctors and other medical professionals. Its structure allows profits to be reinvested into user-driven software development and service improvements, ensuring the platform evolves to meet the needs of healthcare professionals and their patients.

OpenOSP offers a variety of commercial services, including cloud-hosted and on-site EMR solutions, as well as data migration from other EMR systems. The cooperative also supports integrated telehealth, online booking, and faxing options, helping healthcare providers streamline their operations. OpenOSP's approach gives clinicians more control over their data, ensuring freedom from vendor lock-in and offering flexibility to focus on patient care.
